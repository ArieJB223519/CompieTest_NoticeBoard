      "Content": "This isn’t a dream — I’m being bumped out of bed. I drop back onto the mattress, bleary-eyed and blinking away residual sleep in the inky darkness of early morning, and then there’s one second, two seconds of rattling before the next bump comes. For one more brief moment I’m airborne, hanging like a magician’s assistant in mid-air.",

Relaunched and revamped in February 2024 after a pandemic-induced four-year hiatus, the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express’s Southeast Asian sister has returned to ply the jungles of Malaysia. And once it gets going, it rarely stops moving.",

      "Content": "Finding the current’s starting point is crucial, because scientists do know where it ends up. The IFSJ—a deep, dense-water current—starts somewhere in the Nordic seas and flows south and east, eventually hurtling through the Faroe Bank Channel, a gap in the undersea ridge that runs from Greenland to Scotland. From there, the waters feed into the lower limb of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, or AMOC.",
